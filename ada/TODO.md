## Immediate plans

  * If function body consists of a sole expression use a short notation:

        function My_Function return Integer is (42);

  * Replace empty procedures with NULL bodies:

        procedure My_Proc is null;

## Future plans

  * Implement nested functions. Every diagram that has name different from the
    section is considered nested
